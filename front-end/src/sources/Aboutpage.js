                        CS-ST). He had his primary education in Holy Child College of Davao (HCCD) and graduated
                        secondary education from Davao Christian High School (DCHS) class of 2019 (STEM).

                        <br />
                        His main research interest lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV).
                        As of time of writing, he has reviewed some research papers on the topics and reading up on
                        machine learning techniques. However, no hands-on work has been made so far. On the other hand,
                        his main development skill set leans more into Full Stack Web Development (esp Back-end),
                        DevOps, & Computer Software Development.
